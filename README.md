This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to array keys and type juggling. When non-integer values are used as array keys, PHP's implicit type conversion can lead to unexpected behavior. The `bug.php` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.php` provides a solution.

The core issue lies in PHP's handling of floating-point numbers as array keys.  While it might seem intuitive to treat `1.5` as a string key, PHP will actually treat it as a numeric key, potentially leading to data loss or unexpected results if you're expecting string-based keys.

The solution emphasizes explicit type casting to ensure consistent key behavior and prevents ambiguity.

This example highlights the importance of understanding PHP's loose typing and type juggling to avoid unexpected errors.
